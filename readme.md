# **Smash Amiibo Editor**

## *DISCLAIMER: Use of edited amiibo in amiibo tournaments that don't specifically allow it can result in a permanent tournament ban.*

# Encryption Keys

Smash Amiibo Editor supports both key_retail.bin and locked-secret.bin + unfixed-info.bin.

*Note: You can select these keys in the application if you don't put them in the resources folder.* **You have to obtain the keys yourself, we will not provide them.**


# Regions

Smash Amiibo Editor uses a .json file compiled with the latest amiibo knowledge for your editing ease.
if you would like to create a region json of your own (or append to the end of one), use [this tool](https://github.com/jozz024/sae-region-maker/releases/latest).

It also has backwards compatibility with [amiibox](https://github.com/fudgepop01/amiibox)'s regions.txt format, but we strongly suggest you use the one provided for good result.

# The Amiibo Research Document

The region files included with the releases of Smash Amiibo Editor are heavily based on the data from [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3c-QKr46ATTSxaicPHNFq5uW-uRytVViPRvdM93IQo/).
