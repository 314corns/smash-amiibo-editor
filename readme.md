# **Smash Amiibo Editor**
***
### *DISCLAIMER: Do not use edited amiibo in tournaments unless the TO explicitly allows them. Doing so can result in a permanent tournament ban.*

## Encryption Keys

Smash Amiibo Editor supports both key_retail.bin and locked-secret.bin + unfixed-info.bin. Either place them in the resources folder or select them upon program startup.
**You have to obtain the keys yourself, we will not provide them.**

## Regions

Smash Amiibo Editor uses a .json file compiled with the latest amiibo knowledge for your editing ease. We provide a regions file with the most up to date amiibo research.
If you would like to create a region json of your own (or append to the end of one), use [this tool](https://github.com/jozz024/sae-region-maker/releases/latest).

It also has backwards compatibility with [amiibox](https://github.com/fudgepop01/amiibox)'s regions.txt format, but it is strongly suggested to use the one we provide.

## Templates

Templates are a new tool to assist in amiibo research. They can be used to apply pre-configured values to specific sections of a regions file. The provided templates are: max, min, and default. Max maximizes every value, min minimizes every value, and default sets every value to what is thought to be "default" values. You can also make your own templates!

## Amiibo Research Document

The region files included with the releases of Smash Amiibo Editor are heavily based on the data from [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3c-QKr46ATTSxaicPHNFq5uW-uRytVViPRvdM93IQo/).
