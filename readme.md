# **Smash Amiibo Editor**

## *DISCLAIMER: Use of edited amiibo in amiibo tournaments that don't specifically allow it can result in a permanent tournament ban.*

# Encryption Keys

Smash Amiibo Editor supports both key_retail.bin and locked-secret.bin + unfixed-info.bin.

*Note: You can select these keys in the application if you don't put them in the resources folder.*

# Regions

Smash Amiibo Editor uses a .json file compiled with the latest amiibo knowledge for your editing ease.
if you would like to create a region json of your own (or append to the end of one), use [this tool](https://github.com/jozz024/sae-region-maker/releases/latest).
